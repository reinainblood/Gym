# Description

OpenAI-compatible model server using Gym's shared HTTP client.

## HTTP retries

HTTP 404 and 408 are retryable by default, alongside the existing transient
server and rate-limit errors. This applies to every dataset and to policy and
judge clients. A permanent 404 still fails after the bounded attempt budget.
Retries resend the same request with the existing fixed 0.5-second delay
between attempts and preserve the terminal error body.

`max_http_attempts` defaults to three total attempts. Set it per model server:

```yaml
judge_model:
  responses_api_models:
    openai_model:
      max_http_attempts: 5
```

A value of one disables HTTP retries. Connection-error retries are controlled
separately. Internal Gym clients retain their existing unbounded extension for
rate-limit statuses; 404 and 408 never trigger that extension.
