# OSWorld Benchmark

This package prepares and runs the
[OSWorld](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OSWorld) desktop benchmark through NeMo
Gym. It owns the task data, benchmark composition, runner/model overlays,
asset preparation, launch recipes, and operational documentation.

The reusable Responses API runtime lives in
[`responses_api_agents/osworld_agent`](../../responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/README.md).
That README is the source of truth for request/response semantics, supported
runners, agent ownership, parser contracts, and runtime configuration. The
runtime uses an unmodified, pinned OSWorld dependency. Gym's selected Docker or
OpenSandbox provider owns the VM lifecycle while OSWorld keeps its setup,
action, and evaluator behavior intact.

## Deployment roles

The runtime has three explicit roles:

```text
MODEL_HOST  ←─ model HTTP ─  AGENT_CONTROL_HOST
                              prepare / control / eval
                                      │
                                      ├─ Docker / Docker SSH → ENVIRONMENT_HOST → KVM VM
                                      └─ OpenSandbox API → server-managed KVM Pool → VM
```

- The model host serves a compatible vision-language model. It does not run
  Gym eval or OSWorld VM containers.
- In the Docker path, the environment host needs Docker, `/dev/kvm`, and the
  verified qcow2. It does not need the benchmark or agent checkout.
- In the OpenSandbox path, the management service and pre-provisioned Pool own
  the environment capacity, VM image, and entrypoint.
- The agent/control host needs this Gym checkout, the task input, and the same
  qcow2 path for preparation-time identity validation. It runs `prepare.py`,
  `tools/start_control.sh`, and `tools/run_eval.sh`.

For a local smoke test, the agent/control and environment roles may be the same
machine and `DOCKER_HOST` remains unset. For split hosts, complete the one-time
Docker SSH setup below. Start the model first, verify the environment second,
then prepare and run Gym. Neither the operator workstation nor a persistent
interactive SSH session is part of runtime communication.

### Chrome CDP port ownership

OSWorld task setup, rather than a deployment script or the Gym adapter, owns
the guest processes that expose Chrome DevTools. Canonical tasks launch Chrome
with `--remote-debugging-port=1337` and then launch
`socat tcp-listen:9222,fork tcp:localhost:1337`. `DesktopEnv.reset()` executes
both commands from `verifier_metadata.osworld_task.config` for each fresh VM.

The Docker image or OpenSandbox Pool must include `socat` and publish guest
port 9222; Gym forwards that published HTTP/WebSocket endpoint to OSWorld. A
user running canonical OSWorld inputs does not need to run either command
manually. Authors of custom inputs must include the relay whenever their task
setup starts Chrome CDP on port 1337. `prepare.py` checks this contract and
fails early with the missing setup command instead of allowing a later 502.

A standalone Sandbox API smoke test that bypasses `DesktopEnv.reset()` must
start both Chrome and the relay before probing port 9222. Screenshot-only
checks against the OSWorld service on port 5000 do not require this relay.

## Requirements

- Linux x86_64 with Docker 20+ and access to the local Docker daemon.
- 16 GB or more host RAM per concurrent rollout.
- About 30 GB free disk for the Docker image and `Ubuntu.qcow2` cache.
- A reachable vision-language model endpoint. Text-only models cannot act on
  screenshot observations.
- For the Gym Docker path, Docker and read/write access to `/dev/kvm` on the
  environment host.
- For the OpenSandbox path, a reachable API and a pre-provisioned OSWorld KVM
  Pool; Docker, KVM, the VM image, and its entrypoint remain server-side.
- A C compiler and Python development headers on the agent/control host. On
  Ubuntu, install `build-essential` and `python3-dev`; Gym's first server start
  builds the pinned `evdev` dependency in its managed environment.

## Quickstart

From the Gym repository root, first validate the two external role contracts.
For a local environment host, run:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/osworld/tools/probe_model_endpoint.py \
  --base-url https://your-vlm-endpoint/v1 \
  --api-key your-key \
  --model your-vlm-model \
  --image-count 3

bash benchmarks/osworld/tools/check_environment.sh \
  /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2
```

Then enter the benchmark directory and prepare the five-task default run. The
Sandbox path requires the explicit, verified qcow2. Endpoint values can also
be supplied through `POLICY_BASE_URL`, `POLICY_API_KEY`, and
`POLICY_MODEL_NAME`:

```bash
cd benchmarks/osworld
export POLICY_BASE_URL="https://your-vlm-endpoint/v1"
export POLICY_API_KEY="your-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
export POLICY_MODEL_NAME="your-vlm-model"
python3 prepare.py \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2 \
  --force-env
```

Set a run ID, then keep the control wrapper active:

```bash
export OSWORLD_RUN_ID=my-osworld-run
tools/start_control.sh /absolute/run/root
```

After the control log reports ready, run eval in a second terminal or
supervisor:

```bash
tools/run_eval.sh /absolute/run/root
```

If normal termination fails and stale run-owned processes or containers block
recovery, invoke the scoped cleanup fallback while preserving results:

```bash
tools/cleanup_run.sh /absolute/run/root
```

The wrappers write logs beneath the run root. `cleanup_run.sh` is never part of
the normal successful path: it stops recorded processes and removes only that
run's labeled Sandbox containers while preserving results. The exact scripts
used by each role are summarized in [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md).

`prepare.py` validates the committed input and qcow2, records the disk identity,
prefetches setup and evaluator files, and writes a private, gitignored
`env.yaml` containing the config, agent, input, output, cache, and rollout
settings. Hugging Face assets use the official client cache and `HF_TOKEN` when
configured. It keeps an existing env file unless `--force-env` is supplied.
Python component dependencies are installed by `gym env start` from the agent
and model server project files, except for the OSWorld agent's explicitly
opted-in runtime packages. `prepare.py` prints the exact prefetch and install
commands for the selected managed-agent venv before its normal start commands.

Asset preparation is idempotent: `gym env start` checks the same selected JSONL and
shared cache at server startup without contacting the remote source for task
files that are already materialized, then each rollout links only its task's
read-only files into the OSWorld cache. Use `--skip-assets` only to retain
OSWorld's upstream runtime-download behavior. A normal run connects directly;
`OSWORLD_ASSET_PROXY_URL` is an optional fallback used only after an official
Hugging Face download fails.

Prepare and verify the VM image before the first run:

```bash
bash benchmarks/osworld/tools/prepare_osworld_vm.sh
```

The downloader resumes interrupted transfers and verifies the extracted VM by
size and SHA-256. Pass the resulting qcow2 to `prepare.py --vm-path`. Override
`VM_DIR`, `VM_URL`, `VM_SHA256`, or `VM_SIZE_BYTES` only when intentionally
selecting another upstream image.

## Model profiles

Set `runner_name` in the agent config or pass an override to `gym env start`.
See the [agent runtime README](../../responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/README.md#supported-runners)
for the complete runner registry and prompt/action contracts. Prefer selecting
the maintained model/agent composition with `prepare.py --profile`.

### Pointer Agent with Opus 4.7

The Pointer overlay preserves OSWorld's native
`mm_agents.pointer.PointerAgent` planner, executor, verifier, and screenshot
action loop. Point it at the Anthropic-compatible endpoint serving Opus 4.7:

```bash
cd benchmarks/osworld
python3 prepare.py \
  --profile pointer \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2 \
  --policy-base-url https://ANTHROPIC_COMPATIBLE_HOST/v1 \
  --policy-model-name SERVED_OPUS_4_7_MODEL
```

Pointer's optional web tools require `PARALLEL_API_KEY`. Without that variable,
the adapter explicitly disables those tools while retaining the desktop-agent
loop. Set it when leaderboard-aligned web-tool behavior is required.

The reusable OSWorld agent config defines the Docker Sandbox provider. The
generated `env.yaml` activates it, pins the OSWorld image digest, requests KVM,
publishes all four OSWorld service ports on dynamic ports, and supplies the
read-only qcow2 path. Preparation fails before starting Gym if the VM file is
missing. At Sandbox startup the adapter requests `--device /dev/kvm`; the
Docker daemon on the environment host validates that the device is available.

### Nemotron 3 Nano Omni with vLLM

Start the checkpoint through the deployment layer on a model host with enough
GPU memory. After its OpenAI-compatible endpoint is reachable from the Gym
host, prepare the benchmark with the Nano Omni profile:

```bash
cd benchmarks/osworld
python3 prepare.py \
  --profile nano_omni \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2 \
  --policy-base-url http://MODEL_HOST:8000/v1 \
  --policy-model-name SERVED_NANO_OMNI_MODEL
```

Then use `tools/start_control.sh` and `tools/run_eval.sh` exactly as shown in
the quickstart.

The default overlay uses the explicit fixed policy and sends the current
screenshot plus at most two historical screenshots, compacting older
interactions into text. For an endpoint limited to one image per request, use
the same class with `history_policy: {name: fixed, params: {keep_images: 1}}`;
no alternate agent class is required.

Longer training rollouts can opt into a low/high-water snapshot window without
changing standalone benchmark defaults:

```yaml
history_policy:
  name: hysteresis
  params: {low_water: 3, high_water: 10}
```

This accumulates 1 through 10 live screenshots, then compacts the old prefix
into text and falls back to 3: `1, 2, ..., 10, 3, 4, ..., 10, 3`. Each exact
model-call record includes the policy identity, snapshot count, window start,
min/max settings, and whether that call triggered compaction. The legacy
`max_trajectory_length: 3` plus `agent_kwargs.max_live_images: 10` form remains
compatible and resolves to the same identity.

Nano Omni history contains Thought and Action only; previously executed Code is
not repeated. This prompt contract is implemented directly by the standard
`NemotronV3NanoOmniAgent`, so deployments must not stage a Python subclass or
extend `PYTHONPATH` with a reproduction overlay.

### OpenSandbox Pool backend

The `gym_opensandbox` backend keeps the same OSWorld agent, task setup, action,
and evaluator path while replacing the local or remote Docker lifecycle with
an allocation from a server-managed KVM Pool. The Pool operator owns its VM
image, entrypoint, and capacity. Consequently, clients provide neither a
VM image nor `--vm-path`; they name a pre-provisioned Pool and pass a small
compatibility image solely because the OpenSandbox SDK requires one. The Pool
supplies the actual OSWorld VM and does not use that compatibility image. The
checked-in defaults are `osworld-kvm` and `busybox:1.36`, overridable with
`OPENSANDBOX_POOL_REF` and `OPENSANDBOX_COMPAT_IMAGE`.

Install Gym with the OpenSandbox SDK and configure the management endpoint.
Keep credentials in the environment; `prepare.py` does not write the API key
to `env.yaml`:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra sandbox
export OPENSANDBOX_BASE_URL=opensandbox.example.com:8080
export OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENSANDBOX_API_KEY
export OPENSANDBOX_POOL_REF=osworld-kvm
```

Verify the model endpoint with the request shape used by Nano Omni, then
prepare a run. The input, output, and server-environment paths are client-owned
durable paths; choose them outside a small login home when running on a shared
cluster:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/osworld/tools/probe_model_endpoint.py \
  --base-url http://MODEL_HOST:8000/v1 \
  --api-key local-vllm \
  --model SERVED_NANO_OMNI_MODEL \
  --image-count 3

cd benchmarks/osworld
python3 prepare.py \
  --profile nano_omni \
  --execution-backend gym_opensandbox \
  --input /absolute/path/to/tasks.jsonl \
  --output /absolute/run/root/results/rollouts.jsonl \
  --server-venv-root /absolute/run/root/server-venvs \
  --policy-base-url http://MODEL_HOST:8000/v1 \
  --policy-api-key local-vllm \
  --policy-model-name SERVED_NANO_OMNI_MODEL \
  --force-env
```

The managed OSWorld agent's default `requirements.txt` respects Gym's global
security and codec exclusions. After `prepare.py` writes `env.yaml`, run the
exact path-aware next steps that it prints. They pre-create the isolated agent
environment and explicitly install the runtime packages that OSWorld imports
but Gym does not ship in packages or containers:

```bash
gym env prefetch
bash ../../responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/install_optional_runtime_deps.sh \
  /absolute/run/root/server-venvs/responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/.venv
```

The script uses `--no-config` only for that named agent venv and installs
cryptography, headless OpenCV, and the matching torchvision wheel. It is
idempotent, but skips installation only when the required versions are both
present and importable. It also reasserts the normal agent's
`numpy>=2.1,<2.5` constraint and installs the OpenCV 4.10 abi3 wheel so the
managed Python 3.13 environment never falls back to building NumPy 1.26 or
OpenCV from source. These are runtime
imports for OSWorld's desktop stack,
but repository policy excludes them from managed package and container
resolution. `skip_venv_if_present: true` in the generated config then lets
`gym env start` reuse the prepared environment. `tools/start_control.sh` checks
the same venv and exits before starting Gym with copyable remediation commands
if the explicit step was skipped; it never installs the packages itself. The
OSWorld agent entrypoint repeats the non-mutating check, so a direct
`gym env start` fails early with the scoped installer command as well.

OpenSandbox may return path-based gateway endpoints with required routing
headers rather than directly routable Pod addresses. The adapter creates
client-local forwarders that preserve those paths and headers for OSWorld's
HTTP services and Chrome CDP WebSockets. The pinned OSWorld revision also
falls back to the guest loopback address when VLC status authentication is
reached through such a gateway, so Chrome, direct desktop, and VLC evaluators
use the same backend without a local source overlay.

Start control and eval with the normal wrappers:

```bash
export OSWORLD_RUN_ID=my-osworld-opensandbox-run
tools/start_control.sh /absolute/run/root
# After control is ready, in a second terminal:
tools/run_eval.sh /absolute/run/root
```

Normal Gym shutdown releases the Sandbox. If an interrupted run leaves an
instance behind, keep the OpenSandbox variables exported and invoke
`tools/cleanup_run.sh /absolute/run/root`. The wrapper stops only processes
whose recorded environment matches `OSWORLD_RUN_ID`, then queries both the
OSWorld and Gym run metadata keys and rechecks exact values before requesting
termination. To audit without changing remote state, run from the repository
root without `--reap`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/osworld/tools/cleanup_opensandbox_run.py \
  --run-id my-osworld-opensandbox-run
```

There is one unavoidable create-timeout boundary: the OpenSandbox server may
accept `Sandbox.create()` while its response is lost or delayed, so the SDK
caller can time out before receiving the sandbox ID. Gym cannot immediately
call `kill()` on an ID it has never observed. This is an SDK/server lifecycle
window, not a reason to maintain a second REST lifecycle in Gym. Attribution
metadata is included in the original create request, so keep a stable,
run-unique `OSWORLD_RUN_ID` and run the exact-ID cleanup above after an abnormal
exit or create timeout. Once the SDK returns a handle, Gym performs normal
`kill()` and local `close()` cleanup directly.

## Multi-environment runs

Set concurrency and data selection during preparation, then use the same two
public runtime wrappers. `--concurrency` controls simultaneous `DesktopEnv`
instances; the selected JSONL controls the task set.

```bash
cd benchmarks/osworld
python3 prepare.py \
  --profile nano_omni \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2 \
  --input data/test_all.jsonl \
  --output /absolute/path/to/results/rollouts.jsonl \
  --concurrency 4 \
  --force-env

export OSWORLD_RUN_ID=my-osworld-run
tools/start_control.sh /absolute/run/root
# After control is ready, in a second terminal:
tools/run_eval.sh /absolute/run/root
```

### Deterministic task sharding

`prepare.py` owns task splitting. Use the same canonical input for every
agent/control profile and select one zero-based shard per profile:

```bash
# Agent/control profile A
python3 prepare.py \
  --profile nano_omni \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /absolute/path/to/Ubuntu.qcow2 \
  --input /absolute/path/to/test_all.jsonl \
  --output /absolute/path/to/results/shard-0/rollouts.jsonl \
  --num-shards 2 \
  --shard-index 0 \
  --force-env

# Agent/control profile B uses the same command with --shard-index 1 and its
# own output directory.
```

Non-empty input rows are assigned by `row_index % num_shards`. This is stable,
disjoint, exhaustive, preserves source order inside each shard, and spreads
adjacent tasks across workers. Beside each generated shard JSONL, preparation
writes a manifest containing the source SHA-256, total/shard task counts, task
IDs, and their digest. The generated shard becomes both the rollout input and
the asset-prefetch input; model and environment hosts never split tasks.

Sharding is optional. Omitting both shard arguments is exactly the original
single-worker behavior: `prepare.py` uses the input JSONL directly and does not
create a shard file or manifest. Any positive shard count works; two is only
the deployment example below.

The repository includes ready-to-use example and small inputs under `data/`.
Generate larger canonical inputs from the exact pinned OSWorld checkout with
`tools/convert_osworld_tasks.py`; do not silently reuse a historical JSONL
after the OSWorld revision changes. The converter writes
`<output>.manifest.json` with the OSWorld commit (when the source is a Git
checkout), source/output hashes, row count, and task-ID digest. A production
run should fail admission if that recorded commit does not match the runtime
OSWorld pin.

For example:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/osworld/tools/convert_osworld_tasks.py \
  --osworld-root /absolute/path/to/JeffPengCoder-OSWorld \
  --manifest test_all \
  --output /absolute/path/to/test_all.jsonl
```

### Split agent and OSWorld environment hosts

The same Gym Docker provider can use a Docker daemon on another Linux host
through Docker's standard SSH transport. The agent/control host still runs
`prepare.py`, `start_control.sh`, and `run_eval.sh`; only the Sandbox container
and QEMU/KVM guest run on the environment host.

#### One-time host preparation

This is infrastructure setup, not part of every benchmark run:

1. Install Docker, make `/dev/kvm` read/write, and put the verified qcow2 at
   the same absolute path on the agent and environment hosts.
2. Provision non-interactive SSH from the agent host to
   `REMOTE_USER@ENV_HOST_REACHABLE_IP`. A dedicated, non-default key is
   recommended.
3. From the agent host, run the checked-in environment check, then verify the
   Docker SSH transport:

```bash
bash tools/check_environment.sh \
  --ssh REMOTE_USER@ENV_HOST_REACHABLE_IP \
  /same/absolute/path/on/both/hosts/Ubuntu.qcow2
export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://REMOTE_USER@ENV_HOST_REACHABLE_IP
DOCKER_HOST=ssh://REMOTE_USER@ENV_HOST_REACHABLE_IP docker info
```

Provisioning may be performed by the cluster administrator. It is complete
once the command above succeeds; no persistent interactive SSH session is
needed.

#### Every run

After the one-time preparation, the public run path remains three commands.
On each agent/control host, export its corresponding environment IP and model
endpoint, then run:

```bash
cd /absolute/path/to/Gym/benchmarks/osworld

export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://REMOTE_USER@ENV_HOST_REACHABLE_IP
export OSWORLD_SANDBOX_PUBLISH_HOST=ENV_HOST_REACHABLE_IP
export OSWORLD_RUN_ID=my-shard-0
export NEMO_GYM_CONTROL_HOST=AGENT_HOST_REACHABLE_IP
export GYM_BIN=/absolute/path/to/Gym/.venv/bin/gym

python3 tools/probe_model_endpoint.py \
  --base-url http://MODEL_HOST:8000/v1 \
  --api-key local-vllm \
  --model SERVED_NANO_OMNI_MODEL \
  --image-count 3

python3 prepare.py \
  --profile nano_omni \
  --execution-backend gym_sandbox \
  --vm-path /same/absolute/path/on/both/hosts/Ubuntu.qcow2 \
  --input /absolute/path/to/test_all.jsonl \
  --output /absolute/run/root/results/my-shard-0/rollouts.jsonl \
  --num-shards 2 \
  --shard-index 0 \
  --server-venv-root /absolute/run/root/server-venvs \
  --force-env

tools/start_control.sh /absolute/run/root
# After control is ready, launch this in the run's second supervisor:
tools/run_eval.sh /absolute/run/root
```

The Sandbox config binds dynamically selected OSWorld ports to
`OSWORLD_SANDBOX_PUBLISH_HOST`, so the agent receives direct plain-HTTP
endpoints on the environment host. Keep `DOCKER_HOST` exported when invoking
`tools/cleanup_run.sh`; its three-label filter then removes only this run's
remote OSWorld containers. No manually maintained interactive SSH session is
required: the Docker CLI opens its SSH transport as needed, while Gym owns all
container operations. For local Docker, an unset or empty publish host defaults
to `127.0.0.1`. A persistent `--server-venv-root` reuses complete server
environments on retries; remove that run-owned directory after dependency
changes to force a rebuild.

### One agent with multiple environment hosts

One agent host can run multiple shards against different environment hosts and
a shared model endpoint. Use one checkout, but give every profile a distinct
run root, `env.yaml`, run ID, and head port. `OSWORLD_ENV_FILE` tells the public
wrappers which run-specific configuration to load.

    AB -- model requests --> MODEL
```

The dashed links are lifecycle control through Docker's SSH transport. The
solid environment links are direct OSWorld controller, observation, action,
and evaluator HTTP traffic. The two profiles share neither `env.yaml` nor head
port, but they may share the same checkout, input, model endpoint, and verified
VM identity.

For profile A, prepare and launch with:

```bash
export RUN_ROOT=/absolute/run/a
export OSWORLD_RUN_ID=shard-a
export OSWORLD_ENV_FILE=${RUN_ROOT}/config/env.yaml
export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://REMOTE_USER@ENV_HOST_A
export OSWORLD_SANDBOX_PUBLISH_HOST=ENV_HOST_A

python3 prepare.py \

  --force-env

tools/start_control.sh ${RUN_ROOT}
# After control is ready, in a second supervisor with the same exports:
tools/run_eval.sh ${RUN_ROOT}
```

Run profile B in two other supervisors with its own run root, `shard-index 1`,
head port `11001`, `ENV_HOST_B`, and run ID. Both profiles may use the same
`POLICY_BASE_URL`; task assignment remains disjoint and exhaustive. A single
profile still uses the unchanged defaults and does not require
`OSWORLD_ENV_FILE`.

## Configuration

`benchmarks/osworld/config.yaml` is the default benchmark config. It chains the
base `responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/configs/osworld_agent.yaml` runtime
with the generic OpenAI-compatible model transport. The complete Nano Omni
profile lives in
`benchmarks/osworld/configs/osworld_agent_nano_omni.yaml`; it selects the base
agent, vLLM transport, Nano Omni runner settings, and Gym Docker Sandbox in one
benchmark-local config.

The [agent configuration reference](../../responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/README.md#configuration)
documents the shared environment, runner, timeout, cache, proxy, evaluation,
and sampling fields. Per-task `responses_create_params` override YAML sampling
defaults, and explicit CLI overrides have the highest priority.

The Nano Omni overlay uses the tested three-image window, a 4096-token response
limit, a five-second post-action wait, and parser retries. Optional parser-error
feedback, repeated-action guidance, and a pre-DONE checklist are available in
`agent_kwargs` without requiring another agent class.

Its `temperature=0.6` and `top_p=0.95` values follow NVIDIA's thinking-mode
recommendation in the
[checkpoint model card](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni-30B-A3B-Reasoning-BF16/blob/24e67ea000b7c2837fc8f9488aa2008524fac8ba/README.md#model-parameters).
The 4096-token output limit is the tested OSWorld agent setting rather than the
model card's longer general-purpose reasoning budget; these values are
model-specific and do not change defaults for other runners.

### Proxy-required tasks

Proxy policy belongs to the Gym OSWorld adapter; VM setup belongs to the pinned
OSWorld `nv-gym` runtime. The integration lines are independent Git refs in
different repositories. Gym connects them only through the immutable OSWorld
commit in `responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/requirements.txt`. That OSWorld
commit merges upstream main `83e85344` and retains the `nv-gym` integration
overlay.

#### OSWorld version selection

| Consumer workflow | Required OSWorld version |
| --- | --- |
| Gym OSWorld benchmark | No manual checkout. The agent package installs the exact SHA from `responses_api_agents/osworld_agent/requirements.txt`. |
| Direct OSWorld, plain Docker/VMware, no proxy-required tasks | Upstream xlang OSWorld main is sufficient; this adapter's pre-fix baseline was `83e8534451ba8b3ab6477448ef3f0a8e563f05be`. |
| Direct OSWorld with `provider_name=remote_docker` | `JeffPengCoder/OSWorld` `nv-gym`, pinned to `f32ab2b74e3ea66e6a8eb0d87876a12ce93904d5` or a reviewed successor that preserves the selected task corpus. |
| Direct OSWorld with proxy-required tasks | The same `nv-gym` pinned SHA; set `PROXY_CONFIG_FILE` and construct `DesktopEnv(enable_proxy=True)`. |
| Direct OSWorld with both features | The same `nv-gym` pinned SHA provides both independent capabilities. |

For a direct integration of the tested version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeffPengCoder/OSWorld.git
cd OSWorld
git checkout f32ab2b74e3ea66e6a8eb0d87876a12ce93904d5
```

Use an immutable SHA in a lockfile or deployment manifest. The integration
branch may move; a recipe always records the exact revision it actually ran.

This pinned revision prevents OSWorld's Chrome setup DEBUG logging from
serializing the complete worker environment into task artifacts. Model and
proxy credentials must remain runtime secrets and are never useful setup
diagnostics.

It also guards dynamic `tinyproxy` installation against PackageKit holding
APT locks after VM boot. PackageKit is stopped and runtime-masked only during
the install, then restored to its prior state; no custom VM image is required.

The adapter defaults to proxy disabled. Set both variables only for a run that
is allowed to use a proxy:

```bash
export OSWORLD_ENABLE_PROXY=1
export PROXY_CONFIG_FILE=/run/secrets/osworld-proxy.json
gym env start
```

The JSON file is local runtime configuration, not a repository asset. It is a
non-empty list of HTTP upstreams. Each entry requires `host` and `port`; omit
both `username` and `password` for an unauthenticated proxy, or provide both
for an authenticated proxy. No cluster-specific hostname is hard-coded.

| Task `proxy` | Global switch | Config | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `false` | `0` | absent | Normal direct-network task |
| `false` | `1` | valid | Normal task; no VM proxy is installed for this task |
| `true` | `0` | any | Normal direct-network task; no VM proxy is installed |
| `true` | `1` | valid | OSWorld installs/uses the VM-local proxy |
| `true` | `1` | absent or invalid | Masked infrastructure result: `proxy_configuration_error` |

An exception while the proxy-marked task is resetting is reported as
`proxy_setup_error`, also with `mask_sample=true`. These cases are never
silently counted as formal reward-zero samples. Successful result metadata
records whether proxy was required, enabled, and configured, but never stores
credentials.

The OSWorld agent accepts explicit boolean values for `OSWORLD_ENABLE_PROXY`
and validates the config before starting work. OSWorld loads the file lazily
only for `proxy: true` tasks, uses the upstream for APT with bounded retry, and
launches Chrome through the loopback-only `127.0.0.1:18888` tinyproxy endpoint.

Task setup commands may optionally declare `expected_returncodes` and
`on_nonzero: score_zero`. These fields express evaluator/setup semantics rather
than model behavior: an allowed return code continues normally, while
`score_zero` records a valid evaluator score of zero instead of masking the
rollout as a harness failure. Tasks that omit both fields continue through the
pinned upstream setup implementation unchanged, including its best-effort
handling of non-zero command results. Absence of a policy must not be inferred
as `expected_returncodes: [0]`, and evaluator type must not be used to guess a
setup contract. Gym-owned setup that is required for runtime correctness must
declare its expected return codes explicitly; the adapter must not rewrite a
canonical task to make an implicit strict policy pass.

The Docker port-allocation lock wait is configurable because concurrent VM
startup can legitimately take longer than the pinned upstream default. Raising
the wait changes only infrastructure failure handling; it does not change
observations, actions, prompts, or evaluator scoring.

### Pre-staged task files

The default `prepare.py` flow writes task setup inputs, evaluator cloud files,
and evaluator postconfig downloads to `benchmarks/osworld/.cache/setup` and
records that absolute path in `env.yaml`. Existing externally prepared caches
remain supported by setting one of `OSWORLD_SETUP_CACHE_DIR`, `OW_SETUP_CACHE_DIR`,
`SPREADSHEETBENCH_SETUP_CACHE_DIR`, or `PPTC_SETUP_CACHE_DIR`; matching files
are linked into the per-task cache before `env.reset()`.

The pre-staged cache may be empty. Missing task files follow OSWorld's normal
download path and are cached on demand; prewarming affects speed and resilience
to transient download failures, not task semantics.

### Binary and raw OSWorld metrics

OSWorld aggregate metrics report both `osworld/binary_success_rate` and
`osworld/raw_reward_rate`. Binary success counts only evaluator scores of 1.0;
raw reward preserves fractional evaluator credit. Both rates use the same
completed-rollout denominator and are reported regardless of `reward_mode`,
which continues to control the training reward returned by each rollout.

## Source composition and external capability patches

The OSWorld integration branch contains only changes owned by that branch.
Third-party or still-unmerged fixes are not copied into it. A complete
runtime may instead use a separate integration branch that contains the exact
external commits as ancestors, preserving their authorship and review history.
Record the final integration commit in every run manifest.

External source requirements are capability-scoped in
`runtime_dependencies.toml`. For example, Pointer running through Gym Sandbox
currently requires Michal Bien's exact runtime-hardening commit, while Nano
Omni training does not:

```bash
python benchmarks/osworld/tools/check_runtime_dependencies.py --list
python benchmarks/osworld/tools/check_runtime_dependencies.py \
  --repo-root "$PWD" \
  --capability pointer-gym-sandbox
```

The second command intentionally fails on the plain OSWorld integration
branch. Fetch the named source branch and merge its exact commit only into a
separate runtime branch, resolve integration conflicts there, then rerun the
checker. Do not copy or squash the external patch into the OSWorld feature
branch. The checker is read-only and never performs a fetch, checkout, merge,
or cherry-pick.

## Logs and artifacts

Set `OSWORLD_TASK_ARTIFACT_ROOT` before `gym env start` to enable per-task
artifacts. Every rollout then receives a collision-safe
`${domain}/${task_id}` directory with:

- `worker.log` and `runtime.log`;
- `traj.jsonl` with task/run identity, observation hashes, model/action steps,
  agent terminal status, evaluator stage, and compact result-file metadata;
- `step_000.png`, `step_001.png`, and subsequent VM observations;
- `vm-exec.jsonl` with controller commands and VM responses;
- `task.json`, `run.json`, `result.json`, and `manifest.json`.

The directory is returned as `verifier_metadata.osworld_artifact_dir`. Leave
`OSWORLD_TASK_ARTIFACT_ROOT` unset to disable these files.

### Full model I/O

For a focused diagnostic run, opt in to exact agent and transport payloads
before starting the canonical Gym control process:

```bash
export OSWORLD_MODEL_IO_LOG="$PWD/results/omni-diagnostic/model-io-agent.jsonl"
export NEMO_GYM_VLLM_TRANSPORT_LOG="$PWD/results/omni-diagnostic/model-io-transport.jsonl"
gym env start
```

This adds `model-io-agent.jsonl` and `model-io-transport.jsonl`. The agent log
includes direct Anthropic Messages calls made by Pointer as well as Gym-routed
calls; credential fields are redacted while model-body content is retained.
Parser events also state whether retry feedback, the pre-DONE checklist, or
repeated-action recovery was injected. Requests may
contain embedded screenshots and prompt content, so these logs can be large
and sensitive. They are disabled by default.

The paths can be set independently with `OSWORLD_MODEL_IO_LOG`,
`NEMO_GYM_VLLM_TRANSPORT_LOG`, and `OSWORLD_VM_EXEC_LOG`.

## Video recording

Set `OSWORLD_RECORD_VIDEO_DIR` before `gym env start`. To select only specific
tasks, also set `OSWORLD_RECORD_VIDEO_TASK_IDS_FILE`. Recording is best-effort
and does not fail the rollout if the VM cannot produce an mp4.

Schema-v2 events carry `run_id`, `adapter`, `task_id`, `domain`,
`task_attempt`, logical `step`, and `parse_attempt` in addition to the event,
call, timestamp, and process identifiers. The agent passes that identity to
the transport logger in HTTP headers; it is not inserted into the model JSON
body. Embedded image data remains in the full request; a separate image index
records encoded/decoded sizes and SHA-256 values for integrity checks. These
files can be large and can contain screenshots or prompt content, so keep the
option disabled for normal runs and apply the same access controls as the
source task data.

## Datasets

The repository includes:

- `data/example.jsonl`: five representative smoke tasks;
- `data/example_rollouts.jsonl`: five sample rollout responses;
- `data/test_small.jsonl`: the 39-task OSWorld smoke subset.

Additional inputs may be supplied with `prepare.py --input`; each JSONL row
must follow the same `verifier_metadata.osworld_task` contract as the committed
examples. Generated full datasets are intentionally not committed.

## Troubleshooting

### `uv` is missing inside `gym env start`

`gym env start` starts component servers in non-interactive shells. If `uv` is only
on an interactive-shell path, expose it on the system path:

```bash
sudo ln -sf "$(command -v uv)" /usr/local/bin/uv
sudo ln -sf "$(command -v uvx)" /usr/local/bin/uvx
```

### The first screenshot times out

The VM image may still be downloading or the guest may still be booting. Check
the task `worker.log`, pre-stage `Ubuntu.qcow2`, and increase `task_timeout`
for slow software-emulated hosts.

### aarch64 hosts

The default `happysixd/osworld-docker` image is x86_64-only. Use an x86_64
rollout host or provide a compatible OSWorld image and provider configuration.
