"""Prepare the APEX 2025 benchmark data.

Downloads MathArena's APEX 2025 finals problems from HuggingFace and converts
them to the Gym benchmark JSONL format with `question` and `expected_answer`
fields. Mirrors the `apex_shortlist` benchmark, but targets the 12-problem
competition finals set (`MathArena/apex_2025`) instead of the larger shortlist.

The dataset revision is pinned so scores stay reproducible.
