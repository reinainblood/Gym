"""Prepare the ArXivMath 04/2026 benchmark data.

Downloads MathArena's ArXivMath 04/2026 release from HuggingFace and converts it
to the Gym benchmark JSONL format with `question` and `expected_answer` fields.

ArXivMath is a research-level final-answer benchmark sourced from recent arXiv
papers. MathArena publishes a new problem set each month and scores each release
on its own leaderboard, so every month is a separate Gym benchmark.
