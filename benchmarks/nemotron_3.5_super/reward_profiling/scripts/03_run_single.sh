# 03 - Reward profiling in one Slurm job: a vLLM prefill/decode endpoint plus the Gym sweep driver.
#
# Forked from ../sbatch_external_vllm.sh; the vLLM half is unchanged, the eval half runs a sweep
# instead of a benchmark split. Run 01_materialize.sh first to produce SWEEP_DIR. Profiles inside
# the job when collection finishes, so a completed job leaves a profile behind; use 05_profile.sh
# to profile a run that was killed, or to re-profile after a merge.

# USAGE
#   MODEL=<ckpt> CONTAINER=<eval sqsh> SANDBOX_CONTAINER=<sandbox sqsh> \
#     SWEEP_DIR=<out>/<nickname> bash $R/scripts/03_run_single.sh

#                     and MOUNTS; SBATCH_* may come from its sbatch block. An env var set here wins

# Does not resubmit itself. For retries on a single job use 03_run_sharded.sh with NUM_SHARDS=1.

#                                          manifest's sbatch block sets these; setting one here
#                                          overrides it. Falls back to nemotron_n4_post / gpu:4 /

# Scale concurrency with decode capacity. Note this is *half* the engines' own
# --max-num-seqs 1024 in vllm_configs/nemotron_3.5_super.sh; the two do not have to match, and
# measurement says neither is the binding constraint. Engines actually ran p50 28-33 concurrent
# sequences, p99 66-210, max 435 (jobs 7060112 and 6706202), because an agentic rollout spends
# most of its wall time in tool calls, sandbox execution and judging rather than generating.
#
# Do not lower this to 128: a run at 128 against D2 sat at 12.5% of capacity with the client
# semaphore, not the GPUs, as the limit (128/(2x1024) = 6.25% of engine capacity), and 128 would
# clip the p99 bursts that are the only
# moments the driver has real work queued. Raising it to 1024 to match the engines is harmless
# but unsupported -- P2D8 requested 4,096 and never had more than ~264 in flight.
#
# Do NOT raise NUM_SAMPLES_IN_PARALLEL above this derived default without re-testing: 8192 (2x)
# on P2D8 killed a decode engine ~30 min into collection with `assert num_new_tokens > 0` in
# vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py:914, which cascaded to NIXL_ERR_REMOTE_DISCONNECT on the other
# engines (job 7062901). The same shape at 4096 ran 1 h 37 m clean with zero connection errors,
# at ~29,941 rollouts/hr sustained (job 7061265; a favourable 553 s window hit 45,452, which is not
# the rate to plan with). More in-flight work reaches a vLLM scheduler edge case long before it
# reaches any capacity limit.
#
# GLOBAL_AIOHTTP_CONNECTOR_LIMIT_PER_HOST is *not* the ceiling here, despite looking like one.
# Gym defaults it to 1024 / num_workers (server_utils.py:96,163) and aiohttp keys limit_per_host on
# (host, port), but the client that talks to the router lives in each Gym agent server process --
# 63 of them -- so the aggregate is ~63k connections, not 1024. It has never been close to binding:
# 4,096 slots produced ~352 concurrent requests (job 7061265).
#
# The ceilings that could actually bind, in order of likelihood:
#   1. the driver's single asyncio event loop, which is unmeasured
#   2. the sandbox tier, SANDBOX_NODES x SANDBOX_WORKERS concurrent executions
#   3. engine capacity, max_num_seqs x decode_nodes = 8,192 at P2D8
