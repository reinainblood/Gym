Contribute your environment as a one-entry manifest first, prove it runs, then add it to the shared
manifest. A one-entry manifest fails in seconds; the same mistake in the shared one costs a full
spin-up on every shard.

See [README.md](./README.md) for the pipeline itself. `R=benchmarks/nemotron_3.5_super/reward_profiling`
throughout, and all paths below are relative to the repo root.

### Files you touch

| file | when | what |
|---|---|---|
| your data `.jsonl` | always | one row per task, on `/lustre`. Not committed |
| `resources_servers/<env>/` | only if your env is not already in Gym | verifier + config. See the [environment guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/gym/latest/contribute/environments) |
| `$R/manifests/<yours>.yaml` | always | your one-entry manifest. Committed |
| `$R/manifests/nemotron_3_5_super.yaml` | step 04 | add your entry to the shared sweep |
| `$R/configs/container_config.yaml` | only if you pulled in a new server | regenerate, do not hand-edit |

Nothing else. In particular you do not edit anything under `nemo_gym/`, and you do not edit
upstream configs under `resources_servers/*/configs/` to bind a judge — that goes in your manifest
([02b](#02b---judge-environments)).

### What your data rows need

```json
{ "agent_ref": { "name": "my_simple_agent" },
  "responses_create_params": { "input": [ ... ] } }
```

`agent_ref.name` is what rollout collection dispatches on — it is why 36 environments can share one
deployment. It must match the `agent` your manifest entry declares, and that agent must be declared
by one of the entry's `configs`. `validate` checks all three agree.

Add `verifier_metadata` only if your verifier reads it — the reference answer, expected tool call,
or test cases it scores against. Most entries in the shared manifest do not carry one, because
their verifiers score the response intrinsically. Nothing in the sweep looks at it.

## 01 - Creating a container.

Only needed if your environment's servers are not already baked into the reward profiling
container. A server with no baked venv installs at runtime and hangs the run behind connection
retries rather than failing, so check first:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$R python -m infra container-config $R/manifests/<yours>.yaml --output /tmp/mine.yaml
python -c "
import yaml
have = set(yaml.safe_load(open('$R/configs/container_config.yaml'))['config_paths'])
mine = set(yaml.safe_load(open('/tmp/mine.yaml'))['config_paths'])
print('\n'.join(sorted(mine - have)) or 'nothing new; reuse the existing container')
"
```

A plain `diff` is not the check — the committed config covers 36 entries and yours covers one, so
they always differ. What matters is whether your `config_paths` are a subset of it. Anything
printed is a server the container does not have: regenerate `configs/container_config.yaml` over
all manifests and rebuild, per [README.md § 01](./README.md#01---optional-create-a-container).

## 02 - Creating a single manifest file.

Copy the closest `manifests/example_*.yaml` and change `entries`. Every entry needs `label`, `agent`,
`configs` and `data`. `owner` is optional in the schema but expected for new entries — it is you, because the `/lustre` path stops
identifying anyone once the data is copied or a blend is re-cut.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$R python -m infra validate $R/manifests/<yours>.yaml
```

This checks the configs exist, the agent is declared by one of them, the data parses, and each
row's `agent_ref` matches. That last check is what stops a mispaired dataset and config from
silently scoring rollouts with the wrong verifier.

### 02a - Non-judge environments.

Nothing beyond the entry itself. See [`manifests/example_basic.yaml`](./manifests/example_basic.yaml).

### 02b - Judge environments.

Shipped configs name a judge but never an endpoint, so bind one under `gym_env_start` in your
manifest. Skip this and the composed config fails to resolve — the run dies at parse, before a
single rollout.

Two keys, both in [`manifests/example_judge.yaml`](./manifests/example_judge.yaml): the model server
itself, and the binding that tells your resources server to use it.

Set `max_concurrent_requests` if the judge is an external endpoint, as the ones in the shared
manifest are. The transport retries 429s with a flat sleep and extends its retry budget on rate
limits, so a saturated gateway degrades into a retry storm rather than backpressure. A judge served
locally has no such limit and does not need it.

### 02c - Sandbox environments.

Two extra things, in [`manifests/example_sandbox_judge.yaml`](./manifests/example_sandbox_judge.yaml):

- Register every `verifier_type` your rows use under `ns_tools.verifiers`. Rows carry it per-row,
  and an unregistered name is a hard `ValueError` that reaches the driver as a bare 500 — the lane
  produces zero rollouts rather than bad ones.
- If the verifier is judge-backed, enable the judge explicitly. `math_with_judge` verifies
  symbolically via math-verify by default and only consults the judge as a fallback.

## 03 - Running a single manifest job.

```bash
MANIFEST=$R/manifests/<yours>.yaml OUT_DIR=$R/outputs/sweeps/<name> LIMIT_PER_ENTRY=8 \
  bash $R/scripts/01_materialize.sh

MODEL=<ckpt> SWEEP_DIR=$R/outputs/sweeps/<name>/<nickname> bash $R/scripts/03_run_single.sh
```

`LIMIT_PER_ENTRY=8` takes only the first 8 rows of your dataset instead of all of them, so at
`num_repeats: 8` that is 64 rollouts — enough to exercise every code path in minutes. Drop it for
a real run.

If a policy endpoint already exists, skip the GPUs entirely — this is the fastest loop for checking
a new entry, since there is no allocation to wait for:

```bash
SWEEP_DIR=<sweep> POLICY_BASE_URL=http://host:8000/v1 POLICY_MODEL_NAME=<model> \
  POLICY_API_KEY=<key> bash $R/scripts/03_run_endpoint.sh
```

The judges are already a hosted endpoint either way, so only the policy costs GPUs. A sandbox entry
still needs `NEMO_SKILLS_SANDBOX_HOST/PORT` pointed somewhere reachable, since this path starts no
sandbox of its own. Every other variable is in [README § Common knobs](./README.md#common-knobs).

If you want a *committed* subset — your dataset has 200k rows and only 10k belong in the sweep —
that is `limit` on your entry, or `materialize.limit_per_entry` for a manifest-wide default. Set
`materialize.sample: random` with a `seed` if the first N rows would be a biased sample.

Not `gym eval run --limit`, which looks equivalent: it takes the first N rows of the whole input,
so against the full sweep in step 04 it never reaches your entry ([why](./README.md#gotchas)).

Then profile and read the result:

```bash
SWEEP_DIR=$R/outputs/sweeps/<name>/<nickname> bash $R/scripts/05_profile.sh
cat $R/outputs/sweeps/<name>/<nickname>/by_label/<label>/profile.txt
```

Check `by_label/split_report.json` for `labels_without_rollouts`. Your label at zero means the lane
failed rather than scored badly — read `outputs/.../slurm-logs/` for the 500.

Reward is not the only signal worth a look. A `std/reward` of 0 across every task usually means the
verifier is returning a constant, not that the model is perfectly consistent.

### 03a - Non-judge environments.

Nothing extra.

### 03b - Judge environments.

Export the keys `env.yaml` interpolates, e.g. `NVI_KEY_EVALUATOR`. A bare `VAR=value` in `.bashrc`
is a shell variable, not an environment one, so sbatch never sees it — and `export` in `.bashrc`
only reaches a login shell. `03_run_single.sh` and `05_profile.sh` both check this up front and name what
is missing.

### 03c - Sandbox environments.

The shared manifest's `srun.sandbox_container` already names one; a standalone manifest needs its
own, or `SANDBOX_CONTAINER=<nemo-skills sqsh>`. Without it `ns_tools` falls back to `127.0.0.1:6000`,
where nothing listens, and every rollout fails with a bare 500. `03_run_single.sh` starts one and waits
for `/health` before collecting, so watch that gate rather than the rollout count.

Sandbox capacity is `sandbox_nodes x sandbox_workers` concurrent executions. The image forces one
uWSGI process per worker, so the worker count *is* the concurrency — a session pins to a worker by
`X-Session-ID` consistent hashing and holds it. `sandbox_nodes` defaults to every node in the job;
the sandboxes ride along on the vLLM nodes and are fronted by an nginx balancer hashing the same
header, so they cost no extra nodes. If your environment executes code, size this rather than
assuming GPUs are the limit. Only one arm64 build exists:
`/lustre/fsw/portfolios/llmservice/users/igitman/images/nemo-skills-sandbox-0.7.1-arm64.sqsh`

## 04 - Adding a manifest entry into manifests/nemotron_3_5_super.yaml

Once your entry runs clean alone, move it into
[`manifests/nemotron_3_5_super.yaml`](./manifests/nemotron_3_5_super.yaml):

- **Append to `entries`, never insert.** Order assigns task indices, so appending keeps every
  existing `--resume` key valid; inserting in the middle renumbers every entry after yours and
  invalidates work already collected.
- **Merge your `gym_env_start` keys into the shared block**, reusing the judge anchors already
  defined there rather than declaring a second endpoint for the same model.
- **Regenerate the container config** if you added a server, and rebuild.
- **Re-validate, then re-run with `LIMIT_PER_ENTRY=2` over the whole manifest** (2 rows per entry, so 576 rollouts across all 36). Your entry can
  resolve alone and still collide once composed with 35 others — a port, a judge binding, or a
  server that was never baked into the container.

Open the PR against this branch with the `LIMIT_PER_ENTRY` profile output for your label.
