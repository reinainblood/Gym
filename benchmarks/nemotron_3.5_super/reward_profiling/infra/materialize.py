"""Expand a sweep manifest into Gym's materialized-inputs file, in parallel.

Rollout collection expands `num_repeats` itself, single-threaded, at roughly 300 source rows/s --
about 100 minutes for a full sweep on a 144-core node, paid on every launch. Doing it here instead
parallelizes across entries and lands the result exactly where Gym's resume path looks for it, so
subsequent runs skip preprocessing entirely.

Identity is assigned deterministically from manifest order and within-file line order, so
regenerating on a different node reproduces the same `(_ng_task_index, _ng_rollout_index)` keys and
`--resume` still matches rollouts completed by an earlier job.
