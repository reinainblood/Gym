"""Run many (dataset, config) pairs as a single Gym job.

A sweep manifest lists entries, each pairing one input JSONL with the configs that
define the agent it dispatches to. Because rollout collection routes every row by its
own `agent_ref`, the entries can be concatenated into one input file and served by one
Gym deployment composed from the union of their configs.
