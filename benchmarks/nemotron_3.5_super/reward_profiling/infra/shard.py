"""Split a materialized sweep across several jobs, and merge their rollouts back.

One job cannot use 256 nodes: ``--segment`` needs a topology-contiguous allocation and an NVL72
rack is 18 nodes. Several identical jobs over disjoint slices of the same input is the shape that
scales. (This used to also cite the aiohttp per-host connector limit; that was wrong -- the limit
applies per Gym server process and there are 63 of them, so it has never bound.)

Sharding also cuts the per-job driver preflight, a linear scan of the input before the first
dispatch: ~20 min over the full 271.5 GiB, about a minute over a 1/16 shard, paid again on every
resubmission.

This is safe because ``materialize`` stamps ``_ng_task_index`` **before** any sharding and Gym
preserves it through collection -- it is a reserved key, present on 100% of rollouts measured.
Indices therefore stay globally unique across shards, so shard rollouts concatenate without
renumbering and ``split`` gives the same answer on the merged file as on an unsharded run.
(``_ng_sweep_label`` is stamped too but most agents drop it; see materialize.)

Rows are dealt round-robin rather than sliced into contiguous blocks. A contiguous slice would hand
one shard an entire slow environment -- ``lean`` and ``math_cot`` dominate the tail -- while other
shards finish early and idle.
