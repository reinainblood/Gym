# Measured rates, for compute planning

Per-environment throughput, measured lane by lane against `manifests/nemotron_3_ultra.yaml`
(now archived; `nemotron_3_5_super.yaml` has the identical entry list, so the rates carry) on
1 prefill + 2 decode = **12 GPUs**, `num_repeats: 8`.

**These are shares of one fleet, not independent capacities.** Every environment in a lane shared
one endpoint, so a fast environment's rate reflects queueing behind slow ones. Use them to rank
which environments dominate; do not sum them for GPU-hours — that overcounts by roughly the number
of environments. Size from the aggregate at the bottom.

| environment | lane | rollouts/hr | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| tau_pivot | plain | 755 | shares an agent with `tau_pivot_aq_mms` |
| tau_pivot_aq_mms | plain | 755 | shared rate |
| comp_coding | plain | 494 | shares an agent with `comp_coding_nemotronx` |
| comp_coding_nemotronx | plain | 494 | shared rate, but 688 KB/row vs 306 — true rate likely lower |
| ds1_augmented | plain | 387 | shares an agent with `ds1_basic` |
| ds1_basic | plain | 387 | shared rate |
| structured_outputs | plain | 385 | shares an agent with `structured_outputs_v2` |

Lane aggregates: **plain 5,621/hr** (concurrency 128), **judge 1,398-2,139/hr** (48),
**sandbox 483/hr** (32, one sandbox node with 32 uWSGI workers).

## Sizing

Size from the mixed-workload run, not from the lanes. Running all 36 together on
2 shards x (1 prefill + 1 decode) = 16 GPUs gave **~5,620 rollouts/hr** (job 6602112/6602113),
i.e. **351 per GPU-hr**, which is the number the sizing below uses. A launcher run at the same shape
touched **~550 rollouts/hr/GPU** at peak (job 6608099/6608100) — an instantaneous peak, not a
sustained rate, so do not size from it.

```
5,808,968 rollouts / 5,620 per hr = 1,034 h on 16 GPUs = 16,540 GPU-hours
```

| nodes | GPUs | wall |
|---|---|---|
| 24 | 96 | 7.2 days |
| 48 | 192 | 3.6 days |
| 96 | 384 | 1.8 days |

Summing the lanes instead gives 23,178-24,409 GPU-hours, and the gap is the point of running them
together: a judge rollout blocked on the gateway and a sandbox rollout blocked on uWSGI hold no GPU
while they wait, so they fill time the GPU-bound environments would leave idle.

Disk, one-time per (manifest, checkpoint): `01_materialize.sh` writes **271.5 GiB** (291.5 GB;
291,527,648,016 bytes) in ~27.5 min from 726,121 source rows, 36 workers. **Peak during the run is
roughly 2x that, ~543 GiB**, because `_parts/` is not removed until concatenation finishes — budget
for the peak, not the result. Sharding copies the file again, so a sharded run peaks near 815 GiB.
Every figure here is GiB; an earlier revision mixed GiB and GB, which differ by 7% at this size.

## P2D8 on full data (job 6706202, 2026-08-29)

First run of the whole 5,808,968-rollout input at a production shape: 2 prefill + 8 decode = 10
nodes, 40 GPUs (TP=4 per node), `nemotron_n4_post` on the `normal` queue, 4 h walltime. The job hit
the walltime; it did not fail.

### Where the four hours went

| phase | wall | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `01_materialize.sh` | 27.5 min | 726,121 source rows -> 5,808,968 rollouts, 271.5 GiB |
| queue wait | ~1 h | `normal` qos behind ~33k pending node-requests |
| vLLM + 63 Gym servers up | 2.5 min | from job start to `All 63 / 63 servers ready!` |
| driver preflight | ~20 min | scans the whole 271.5 GiB input before the first dispatch |
| collecting | 3 h 26 min | 25,494 rollouts |

**The ~20 min preflight is per job, not per sweep** — every resubmission pays it again. It is a
linear scan of the input, so it scales with the file the job is given: a 1/16 shard is ~17 GiB and
pays about a minute. This is a concrete argument for sharding beyond parallelism.

### Throughput

| | |
|---|---|
| collection window | 3.43 h (01:15:11 -> 04:41:01 UTC) |
| rollouts | 25,494 of 5,808,968 (**0.44%**) |
| average | **7,431 rollouts/hr** = **186 per GPU-hr** |
| first hour | 9,429/hr |
| remaining 2.4 h | 6,614/hr |
| driver concurrency | 4,096 (512 x 8 decode nodes) |
| in flight at vLLM | ~33 per engine, so ~264 |
| GPU KV cache usage | **4.5%**, `Waiting: 0 reqs` |

Throughput decays as fast tasks drain, the same tail effect the whole-manifest runs show.

### Only 6 of 36 environments were reached

At 0.44% complete the run touched six environments. Everything else has **zero** rollouts, so it is
unmeasured, not slow:

| environment | rollouts | rollouts/hr | of its target | KB/rollout |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tau_pivot | 8,996 | 2,622 | 0.66% | 30 |
| swe_pivot | 4,479 | 1,306 | 0.84% | 117 |
| structured_outputs_v2 | 4,363 | 1,272 | 1.94% | 26 |
| nvarc_transductive | 4,253 | 1,240 | 5.32% | 111 |
| math_tir | 2,481 | 723 | 7.95% | 128 |
| inverse_if | 922 | 269 | 11.53% | 43 |

These are shares of one contended fleet, not independent capacities, and each environment's
completed tasks sit in a narrow contiguous band of the input rather than spread across its range.
**Do not treat this table as per-domain rates for the blend** — six of thirty-six, at half a
percent, is not a sample worth sizing from. The 12-GPU lane table above is still the better basis.

### What is actually starving the GPUs

4.5% KV cache with `Waiting: 0` means vLLM is never the constraint. The log says where the other
~93% of the concurrency window went:

- **The `vllm-router` is a single process on one node** (`nodes[0]`, port 8000). It absorbed
  **483,000 `ClientOSError`s**, and individual requests reached **`retry=954`** — a request
  retrying ~950 times holds a concurrency slot indefinitely without ever reaching a GPU. (Read the
  `Hit N global` counter, not the 12,495 printed lines: Gym logs roughly one line per 100 errors.)
- **The sandbox is one node** serving all 63 Gym servers: 1,168 IPython session timeouts, 190x502,
  137x504. Its two consumers, `ns_tools` and `lean`, returned **zero** rollouts.
- **Agentic rollouts are mostly not on the GPU.** `tau_pivot` and `swe_pivot` spend their wall time
  in tool calls, env stepping and sandbox execution. Low KV usage is the expected shape for this
  blend, not purely a defect.

**The judge is not the bottleneck.** Correcting the earlier reading of this run: the judge is the
hosted endpoint (`https://inference-api.nvidia.com/v1`) and it took **4 retries in the whole run**,
against 483,000 to the local router. Note the judge-heavy environments produced no rollouts, so the
judge is untested at load here rather than proven healthy.

### Sizing at this shape

```
5,808,968 / 6,614 per hr (steady) = 878 h on 40 GPUs = 35,132 GPU-hours   -> 36.6 days on one P2D8
                                                                          -> 2.3 days on 16 shards of P2D8
```

That is roughly twice the 16,540 GPU-hours estimated from the 16-GPU run (186 vs 351 per GPU-hr):
2.5x the GPUs bought about 1.3x the throughput. At the time this read **fix the router and the
sandbox tier before adding decode nodes**; both were fixed in job 7061265 below, and this sizing is
superseded by the section after it. Kept as the before-picture, not as advice.

## P2D8 after the router and sandbox fixes (job 7061265, 2026-09-10)

Same shape and same input as 6706202 above, resumed from its 25,494 rollouts, with the
`vllm_router` block and the multi-node sandbox tier in place. Measured over a 553 s steady-state
window about 25 min into collection:

| | old (6706202) | fixed (7061265) |
|---|---|---|
| rollouts/hr | 7,431 | **45,452** |
| per GPU-hr | 186 | **1,136** |
| MB/hr | 505 | **2,048** |
| `ClientOSError` (the `Hit N global` counter) | **483,000** | **0** |
| GPU KV cache usage | 4.5% | 3.3% |
| sandbox concurrency | 32 (1 node) | 640 (10 nodes x 64) |

Rollouts/hr is 6.1x and MB/hr is 4.1x; the difference between those two is composition, because the
environments in flight during this window average 45.1 KB/rollout against the old run's 67.9. **Take
the 4.1x as the throughput result**, and treat both as early-phase: the old figure is an average
over 3.43 h including tail decay, this one is a window before any decay.

The connection errors are gone outright rather than reduced. Note this did not reproduce at small
scale -- the P1D2 smoke (job 7060112) still logged 39,300 with the identical router settings -- so
the error mechanism is still not fully understood, and the counter is worth watching on every run.

Still **6 of 36 environments** in flight at a time, the same as before: the driver works a handful
of contiguous regions of the input concurrently, and that is unchanged by these fixes. It now moves
through them roughly six times faster. `stem_mcqa_tools_ultra_0` is among them at 3,268 rollouts,
against zero for every sandbox environment in the old run -- the clearest single sign the sandbox
tier was the binding constraint for that lane.

KV cache usage did *not* rise, so the GPUs are still not the limit even at 6x the rollout rate.

### Sizing after the fixes

This supersedes the *Sizing* section near the top of the file.

> **Still optimistic — read the decay note below before sizing from this.** 29,941/hr is itself a
> first-69-minutes figure, and throughput falls steadily as the fast environments drain.

Plan from the **sustained** rate, not the window figure: job 7061265 collected 34,432 rollouts in
69 min of collection = **29,941 rollouts/hr**, i.e. **749 per GPU-hr** on 40 GPUs.

```
5,808,968 / 29,941 per hr = 194 h on one P2D8 = 7,762 GPU-hours
                                              -> 8.1 days on one P2D8
                                              -> 12.1 h on 16 shards of P2D8 (160 nodes)
```

| | GPU-hours | basis |
|---|---|---|
| pre-fix P2D8 (6706202) | 35,132 | 186 /GPU-hr, router and sandbox both broken |
| 16-GPU estimate | 16,540 | 351 /GPU-hr, the old headline number |
| **post-fix P2D8 (7061265)** | **7,762** | **749 /GPU-hr** |

So the fixes moved this from *twice the cost of the small shape* to *half of it*. Two things this
does not include: each job pays a ~20 min driver preflight (~12% of a 4 h walltime, and much less
per shard), and the rate above is measured before any tail decay.

### Throughput decays through a run — do not size from a short window

Job 7086601 (P2D8, full data, all fixes in place), three consecutive windows measured as the run
progressed:

| into collection | rate | per GPU-hr |
|---|---|---|
| ~10 min | 17,481/hr | 437 |
| ~30 min | 11,778/hr | 294 |
| ~50 min | ~7,171/hr | 179 |

Each window is lower than the last. This is the same tail effect the whole-manifest runs show
(151 -> 55 -> 18 -> ... rollouts per 30 s window): fast environments finish early and the residue is
slow work, so **any estimate taken from the first hour is an overestimate**, including the
29,941/hr above and every ETA derived from it.

What follows is that a single P2D8 cannot finish this input. At 11,778/hr the remaining 5.7M
rollouts need ~486 h — 20 days of continuous 10-node allocation, i.e. 120 sequential 4 h jobs, each
paying the ~20 min preflight. Sharding is not an optimisation here, it is the only viable shape.

The honest sustained number is still unmeasured: no run with the fixes has yet completed a full
walltime. Until one does, treat every figure in this file as an upper bound on throughput.

### Sizing the sharded shape — and a correction

Every "N shards" figure elsewhere in this file was produced by multiplying a **single-job P2D8
rate** by the shard count. That silently assumes each shard is itself a P2D8. An earlier revision
paired that arithmetic with a node count computed for 1-prefill-2-decode shards, which understated
the fleet by 3.3x: "16 shards, 48 nodes, 9.8 h" cannot be true, because 16 shards each running at
the measured P2D8 rate is 160 nodes.

Consistent, from the one post-fix measurement (job 7090847, 1,153 rollouts per GPU-hr) against
5.67M remaining rollouts, with a 78% duty cycle for the ~25 min preflight paid on each restart:

| shape | nodes | GPUs | ETA |
|---|---|---|---|
| 16 x P2D8 | 160 | 640 | 9.8 h |
| 32 x P2D8 | 320 | 1280 | 4.9 h |
| 16 x 1P2D | 48 | 192 | 32.7 h |
| 32 x 1P2D | 96 | 384 | 16.4 h |

**Which shape is most efficient per GPU is unmeasured.** The obvious comparison does not survive
scrutiny: the 351 per GPU-hr from the 16-GPU run and the 186 from the first P2D8 are both *pre-fix*,
and holding the shape constant the router and sandbox fixes moved P2D8 from 186 to 1,153 — a 6x
swing, far larger than any gap between shapes. There is exactly one post-fix datapoint and it is
P2D8.

The manifest therefore defaults to P2D8: not because it is proven fastest, but because it is the
only shape measured end to end since the fixes, and shipping an unmeasured default is what produced
the 48-versus-160 confusion above.

To settle it properly: two shards at 1P2D against two at P2D8, same input slice, compared on
**MB/hr per GPU** rather than rollouts/hr — composition skews the rollout count, as the 6.1x vs
4.1x gap in the section above shows.

## Concurrency has a ceiling, and it is not a capacity limit (job 7062901)

Raising `NUM_SAMPLES_IN_PARALLEL` from the derived 4,096 to **8,192** on the same P2D8 shape killed
a decode engine about 30 min into collection:

```
vllm/v1/core/sched/scheduler.py:914 in schedule
    assert num_new_tokens > 0
AssertionError  ->  EngineDeadError
                ->  NIXL_ERR_REMOTE_DISCONNECT on the surviving engines
                ->  router graceful shutdown
```

It produced 12,640 rollouts, then nothing for the remaining 1 h 40 m while the driver retried
against a dead router: **6,454,400 `ClientOSError`s**, `retry=11993` on a single request,
`elapsed_s` p50 3,130 s. The identical shape at 4,096 ran 1 h 37 m clean with zero connection
errors, at **29,941 rollouts/hr sustained** — the 45,452 quoted above is a favourable 553 s window,
not a planning number.

So the practical ceiling is a vLLM scheduler edge case, reached long before engine capacity
(8,192 sequences), the sandbox tier (640), or the aiohttp connector (~63k). **Leave the derived
default alone unless you are prepared to re-test.**

The 1 h 40 m of dead time was our own bug, not vLLM's: the vLLM `srun` had no
`--kill-on-bad-exit`, so one dead task left the step alive waiting on the other nine and the
launcher's `wait -n` never fired. Fixed; a dead engine now ends the job so the watcher can
resubmit and `--resume` carries the collected work forward.

## Caveats

- **Every rate is a floor, but the client semaphore is no longer the reason.** Each decode engine
  is configured for `--max-num-seqs 1024` (not 512, as this note previously said) and the launcher
  requests 512 per decode node. Neither binds: engines actually ran p50 28-33 concurrent sequences,
  p99 66-210, max 435 across jobs 7060112 and 6706202, because an agentic rollout spends most of
  its wall time in tool calls, sandbox execution and judging rather than generating. The old 128
  concurrency against 2 decode nodes did bind, at 128/(2x1024) = **6.25%** of engine capacity, which
  is why it was raised;
  do not go back to it.
- **Plan around the tail, not the aggregate.** A whole-manifest run went 151 -> 55 -> 18 -> 14 -> 12
  -> 6 -> 3 rollouts per 30 s window — ~18,000/hr instantaneous down to ~360, a 50x collapse. Fast
  environments drain immediately and the slow ones dominate the end. Expect a residue job.
- **Sandbox capacity is a separate axis from GPU count.** It measured lowest of any lane at the
  lowest concurrency, back when it was a single node with 32 workers. It is now `sandbox_nodes x
  sandbox_workers` (640 at P2D8) and no longer the binding constraint — but it still does not scale
  with GPUs, so size it explicitly when adding nodes.
- **The judge lane ran at concurrency 48 against the plain lane's 128**, so the 4x aggregate gap
  overstates the judge penalty. It also measured 1,398 and 2,139/hr on two runs at identical
  concurrency — a 53% spread, probably prefix-cache warmth. Re-measure on a cold endpoint.
- **Two config fixes live in the manifest overlays, not upstream.** `ns_tools` registers only
  `math_with_judge` on main, so rows carrying `verifier_type: mcqa` fail with a bare 500; and
  `abstention` caps its judge at `max_output_tokens: 64`, truncating a reasoning judge mid-thought.
  The sandbox and judge rates here depend on those overlays being present.
