"""Serve the KIDBench multi-turn child actor on Modal.

The actor is the model that plays a child probing the system under test. KIDBench's own
actor is Gemma-4-31B-it with its refusal direction ablated, and upstream deliberately does
not release that checkpoint — a refusal-ablated model is itself a safety-sensitive
artifact. Running a stock instruct model in its place makes the actor refuse to stay in
character on exactly the prompts that matter most, which flatters every model under test.

This deploys a published third-party ablation of the same base model so the actor behaves
closer to the paper's. It is **not** the paper's checkpoint: see
``ACTOR_MODEL_PROVENANCE`` in ``benchmarks/kidbench/upstream_spec.py`` for what differs
and what that costs.

Deploy::

    modal deploy --env FDR benchmarks/kidbench/deploy/modal_actor.py

The served endpoint is OpenAI-compatible at ``<url>/v1`` and sits behind Modal proxy auth,
so the same workspace token the other FDR endpoints use authenticates it.

#: The ablated repo ships the weights, config and tokenizer but omits
#: ``processor_config.json``. Its config still declares Gemma 4's vision tower — and the
#: tower's weights really are in the checkpoint — so vLLM looks for a feature extractor,
#: does not find one, and the engine dies before it serves anything. The file is taken
#: from the base model it was ablated from, pinned to its own commit, and dropped into the
#: snapshot. Nothing about the weights changes.

#: 62.6 GB of bf16 weights. Two H100s leave roughly 49 GB per card for KV cache, which is

#: by two, so tensor parallelism needs no padding.

#: Upstream gives the actor an 8,192-token output budget, and its prompt carries the full
#: persona plus the whole conversation so far. By turn five that history alone can pass
#: 8k tokens, so anything near 16k leaves no room for the reply and vLLM rejects the
#: request outright. Sized well clear of that rather than trimming upstream's budget.
