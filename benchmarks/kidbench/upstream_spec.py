"""The published KIDBench protocol, transcribed from the upstream repository.

Every constant here is a fact about the public benchmark rather than a choice this
adapter makes, so the two stay separable when upstream moves. ``UPSTREAM_REVISION``
pins the commit all of it was read from; :mod:`benchmarks.kidbench.prepare` checks
the working tree against it before materializing anything.

Sources at that revision:

* ``scripts/generation/single_turn/{openai,anthropic,google,deepseek}.sh`` — the
  ten-cell single-turn condition grid and its decoding settings.
* ``scripts/generation/multi_turn/*.sh`` — five turns, generator ``temperature=0``.
* ``scripts/evaluation/single_turn/deepseek.sh`` — the single-turn judge.
* ``scripts/evaluation/multi_turn/deepseek.sh`` — the multi-turn judge.
* ``src/child_safety/utils.py:build_system_prompt`` — the responder system prompts.

The README states ``temperature=0`` for response generation, but every hosted-provider
script in the same revision sets ``0.7`` and only ``vllm.sh`` sets ``0``. The scripts are
what produced the published numbers for hosted models, so :data:`SINGLE_TURN_TEMPERATURE`
follows the scripts. :doc:`METRICS.md` records the discrepancy.
