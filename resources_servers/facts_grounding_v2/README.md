# facts_grounding_v2

FACTS Grounding v2 (FACTS Benchmark Suite, Google DeepMind / Google Research / Kaggle; arXiv:2512.10791, section 6):
long-form answers that must stay grounded in a supplied document, judged for eligibility and sentence-level
grounding by Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-5 with the v2 prompts.

## Protocol reproduced here

| Component | Official source | This server |
|---|---|---|
| Prompts | Kaggle `deepmind/FACTS-grounding-examples` v17, 856 public rows | `benchmarks/facts_grounding_v2/prepare.py` (pinned SHA-256) |
| Model prompt | starter: `full_prompt` as the single user message | baked into each row (`prompt_config: null`) |
| Judges | `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, then `openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07` | `judge_model_servers` in that order (any OpenAI-compatible endpoints) |
| Eligibility | judge writes its own baseline answer, rates the response vs baseline with the v2 no-context prompt; first judge without `Major Issue(s)` wins; unparseable = eligible | `prompts/eligibility_*.txt` (byte-identical), `extract_instruction_rating`, `is_eligible` |
| Grounding | v2 `UFG_REV21` sentence-level prompt per judge; grounded iff every parsed sentence is supported/no_rad/unknown | `prompts/grounding_*.txt` (byte-identical), `parse_grounding_verdict` (starter port) |
| Score | grounding score = mean of judge verdicts; 0 when ineligible | `reward` in {0, 0.5, 1}; `unadjusted_score` kept (both judges run on ineligible answers too) |

Aggregate metrics: `factuality_score` (primary, adjusted), `unadjusted_factuality_score`, `eligibility_rate`,
per-judge `grounded_rate_eligible/<judge>`, `judge_disagreement_rate_eligible`, eligibility-rating and
parse-validity diagnostics, truncation/empty rates, context-token statistics, and domain/type slices. See
[`benchmarks/facts_grounding_v2/METRICS.md`](../../benchmarks/facts_grounding_v2/METRICS.md).

## Running

```bash
export FACTS_GROUNDING_JUDGE_GEMINI_BASE_URL=https://.../v1 FACTS_GROUNDING_JUDGE_GEMINI_API_KEY=... FACTS_GROUNDING_JUDGE_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
export FACTS_GROUNDING_JUDGE_GPT5_BASE_URL=https://.../v1 FACTS_GROUNDING_JUDGE_GPT5_API_KEY=... FACTS_GROUNDING_JUDGE_GPT5_MODEL=gpt-5-2025-08-07

gym eval run --benchmark facts_grounding_v2 --config <policy model config> --split benchmark \

  +route_failures_to_sidecar=true +observability_enabled=true
```

Prompts reach 153k characters; the policy endpoint must accept them without clipping (the verify response records
`policy_input_tokens` so context utilisation can be audited).

## Tests

```bash
gym env test --resources-server facts_grounding_v2
```
