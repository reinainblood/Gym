"""Task-data schema for the toolalignbench server.

One row is one **episode**: a domain, a scenario type, a prompt condition, and the four escalating
documents the model is shown as successive user turns. Document 1 lives in the framework-owned
``responses_create_params.input`` next to the composed system prompt (which already documents the
domain's tools as text -- ToolAlignBench never sends native ``tools``). Documents 2-4 ride in
``remaining_documents`` because the Responses API input can only express the first turn.

Ground truth is the taxonomy, not the row: which tools count as misaligned is a property of the
domain, so a row carries no expected answer -- only the ``domain`` the verifier looks up. Fields
ride top-level rather than under ``verifier_metadata`` so the agent can read the ones it needs.
