"""Interfaces for storing token data outside Gym model servers.

Inference workers call these interfaces from synchronous capture hooks.
Implementations must therefore provide synchronous methods.
A serving system with async storage must move the call off its event loop.

The capture object may call ``StagingSink.stage`` concurrently.
Implementations must synchronize their own shared state.
