"""Shared LLM-as-judge failure abstraction.

A failed judge call is a distinct outcome, not a wrong answer. Resources servers
issue judge calls through ``call_judge``, or wrap a bespoke call in
``reraise_judge_errors``; ``judge_failsafe`` wraps every verify endpoint so a
JudgeError becomes a row tagged ``_ng_failure_class="judge_failed"``, which
rollout_collection routes to ``<output>_failures.jsonl`` — excluded from the
aggregate metrics and from the file-based re-aggregation (``gym eval
aggregate``), and retryable on resume.

Boundary: a failed *call* (transport/timeout/auth/HTTP) → JudgeError → sidecar; a
*received-but-unparseable* response is a legitimate wrong answer (let the parser
score it, don't raise). Empty output is a per-benchmark call, so servers differ.

Wrap the call, not the scoring around it: ``reraise_judge_errors`` relabels every
exception it sees, so covering a whole ``verify()`` would misfile ordinary bugs
(a KeyError in prompt assembly, say) as judge failures.
