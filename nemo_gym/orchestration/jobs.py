"""The record a submission leaves behind.

`api.py` is the input schema (what to submit); this is the output schema (what
was submitted).

This module is executor-agnostic on purpose, and that is a rule rather than a
coincidence: it must describe a submission made by ANY executor -- Slurm today,
k8s or a local runner later. Two consequences, both enforced by
`test_jobs_module_is_executor_agnostic`:

* Nothing here imports from `executors/`, so a reader -- today EFB's collect,
  tomorrow `gym eval status` -- can load a record without pulling Slurm, SSH and
  the sbatch templates into its import path.
* No field is typed or named after one executor's vocabulary. Where a docstring
  explains a value by example, it says which executor the example comes from.

Compatibility. A record outlives the Gym that wrote it, so `schema_version` is
read in one direction only: a reader accepts anything at or below its own
version and refuses only what is newer than it understands. Upgrading nemo-gym
therefore never strands records already on disk.

That is only sound if the schema keeps its side of the bargain, so within one
schema version a field may only be ADDED WITH A DEFAULT, or removed. A field
must never be repurposed or have its meaning changed -- an older record would
then be read as if it meant the new thing. Anything of that kind needs a
`SCHEMA_VERSION` bump and an explicit migration, not a silent reinterpretation.
